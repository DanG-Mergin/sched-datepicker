yet another datepicker (sched.site)

## DEMO & API DOC

https://edwardsharp.github.io/sched-datepicker/

## INSTALL 

```
bower i edwardsharp/sched-datepicker -S
```

## Viewing

```
$ polymer serve
```

## Building (...i guess?)

```
$ polymer build
```

This will create a `build/` folder with `bundled/` and `unbundled/` sub-folders
containing a bundled (Vulcanized) and unbundled builds, both run through HTML,
CSS, and JS optimizers.

You can serve the built versions by giving `polymer serve` a folder to serve
from:

```
$ polymer serve build/bundled
```

## Running Tests

```
$ polymer test
```

Your application is already set up to be tested via [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester). Run `polymer test` to run your application's test suite locally.
